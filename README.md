# Applying DDD Thinking to EF Core Search Filters!

This is a twist on the soluiton in [EF Core 6 and DDD Pluralsight course repo](https://github.com/julielerman/EFCore6andDDDPluralsight).  

Here, I have added a more intelligent search and a UI (a pair in fact) for the dotnet [FWDays '23[(https://fwdays.com/en/event/dotnet-fwdays-2023) presentation, Applying DDD Thinking to EF Core Search Filters![image](https://github.com/julielerman/FilteringwithEFCoreandDDD/assets/5007120/29bd318b-bf4d-4b89-88fd-79b3be75fbdc)

There are two branches:  
1) [UsingASearchContext](https://github.com/julielerman/FilteringwithEFCoreandDDD/tree/UsingASearchContext) has all of the extra solution logic from the course such as unit tests, integration tests, event handlers etc.
2) [SearchContextLite](https://github.com/julielerman/FilteringwithEFCoreandDDD/tree/searchcontextlite) is trimmed down with only the necessary logic to focus on the search demo.
